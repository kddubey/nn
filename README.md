# nn
Neural network training and inference using only NumPy, vectorized

AKA [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) but w/ 2-D matrices

Also, shoutout to broadcasting. Definitely in my top 3 algorithms I take for granted.
(Backprop is still there.)

TODO:
- [ ] `requires_grad` / freezing functionality
- [ ] arbitrary shapes
- [ ] basic NN framework
